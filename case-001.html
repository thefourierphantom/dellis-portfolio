            <div class="space-y-4 text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                <p>
                    Routine monitoring identified repeated outbound HTTPS connections originating from a Windows workstation
                    between approximately 01:30 and 04:00 local time. The system was assigned to a non-technical user and
                    expected to remain idle during overnight hours.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Baseline traffic analysis was conducted to establish expected behavior during normal business operations.
                    After-hours captures were then compared against this baseline to determine whether the activity represented
                    benign system behavior or automated execution.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Investigation scope included packet capture analysis, session timing review, and host-based artifact
                    validation within a controlled lab environment.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Key Findings</h2>

            <div class="space-y-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                <p>
                    During the after-hours capture window, the workstation (10.0.2.15) initiated repeated outbound HTTPS
                    connections to a limited set of external IP addresses. Traffic exhibited consistent timing intervals,
                    suggesting automated rather than interactive behavior.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Baseline traffic included normal HTTPS activity to diverse destinations; however, those connections were
                    irregular, short-lived, and user-driven. The after-hours traffic demonstrated repetitive patterns not
                    present in baseline data.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Endpoint analysis identified a scheduled task named
                    <span class="mono">UpdaterService</span> configured to execute a PowerShell script at user logon.
                    The script performed recurring outbound web requests at fixed intervals.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Correlation of network and endpoint artifacts supports the conclusion that the observed after-hours
                    activity was automated and enabled by a persistent scheduled execution mechanism.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Timeline Correlation</h2>

            <div class="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg border border-gray-200 text-gray-700 space-y-3">
                <p><strong>Event 1:</strong> Scheduled task configured to execute PowerShell script at logon.</p>
                <p><strong>Event 2:</strong> Logon trigger enabled automated script execution.</p>
                <p><strong>Event 3:</strong> Repeated outbound HTTPS sessions observed during non-business hours.</p>
                <p><strong>Correlation:</strong> Persistence mechanism directly explains recurring network behavior.</p>
            </div>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Conclusion</h2>

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                The investigation identified automated outbound network activity inconsistent with baseline user behavior.
                A scheduled task persistence mechanism was validated as the execution vector responsible for the observed
                traffic. Conclusions are limited to evidence available within the lab environment, with no attribution or
                external threat classification made beyond supported artifacts.
